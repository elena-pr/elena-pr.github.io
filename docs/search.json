    "text": "I am a PhD candidate at LSE’s European Institute and I am affiliated with the Data Science Institute at LSE.\nMy research focuses on political behaviour and political identities in the European context. I am interested in how political and civic actions influence public opinion and attachment to political identities.\nI study these topics with observational causal inference, experiments, and mixed-methods research designs.\nPrior to my PhD, I obtained a BA in History and Politics (University of Exeter) and an MSc in Social Research Methods (London School of Economics). You can find here my CV.\nI also love learning and writing about study methods and note-taking techniques, hoping to make academia a bit less daunting and accessible to everyone.
