I am a PhD candidate at LSEâ€™s European Institute and I am affiliated with the [Data Science Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI) at LSE.

My research focuses on political behaviour and political identities in the European context. I am interested in how political and civic actions influence public opinion and attachment to political identities.

I study these topics with observational causal inference, experiments, and mixed-methods research designs.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a BA in History and Politics (University of Exeter) and an MSc in Social Research Methods (London School of Economics). You can find here my [CV](EPro_CV.pdf){target="_blank"}.

I also love learning and writing about study methods and note-taking techniques, hoping to make academia a bit less daunting and accessible to everyone. Check out my [blog](https://elenapro.substack.com/){target="_blank"}!
