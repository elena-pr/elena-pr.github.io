## Civic actions and political attitudes

I investigate the relationship between institutions, civic actions, and the formation of political identities. I focus on how institutionalised forms of civic engagement shape attitudes towards democracy, co-partisans, and political opponents.

## AI and political decision-making

I study whether and how interactions with AI can change citizens' opinions and behaviour. My research looks into persuasion and accountability.

## Political identities

I study the relationship between political identities and political choices. I argue that we should look at how people understand and prioritise social categories when engaging in political decision-making.
